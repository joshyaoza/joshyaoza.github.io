              <h1> about me. </h1>
              <h2> Hello there! Nice to meet you, my name's Josh. I am a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley and I'm currently studying Cognitive Science and Business. My interests range from a multitude of things; whether it be nose deep in the latest Netflix Original series or face deep in a bowl of good food, I can be found spending my free time outside of school doing things I love with the people I love. </h2>
              <h2> I think of myself as one of my favorite foods: hot pot. Hot pot is a combination of many components: throw in chili peppers, sichuan peppercorns, meat, seafood, vegetables -- anything is fine. When you mix it with water, chili oil, and bean paste over a blazing fire, all the individual ingredients blend together to form a truly delicious meal best enjoyed with others. To me, hotpot is life; itâ€™s a fusion of all the ingredients with a specific role to play in its flavor. I attribute who I am today to my roots, to the shacks where I ate stinky tofu, to the afternoons playing mahjong, to the late night boba runs â”€ and thereâ€™s so much more I want people to know. Just like the Bay Area, where I was born and raised, with its numerous cultures, and the hot pot I enjoyed eating amid the din and clamor during winter nights, I am an amalgam of my life experiences and I hope that shows through my work. While you're here, be sure to check out my portfolio! Thanks so much ðŸ˜ƒ</h2>
